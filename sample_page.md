**About** I am currently employed at Assiniboine Community College where I teach in the School of Agriculture & Environment as the Senior Instructor in the GIS Environmental Technology Program. In addition to my on-campus & distance learners, I plan, design and deliver several workshops for educators, specialists and students in the areas of GIS, GPS, and outcome-based learning in relation to technology. I am responsible to establish my own pedagogy for each course including Learning Outcomes and Performance Elements and the successful implementation. Each course has extensive lecture and lab components. I also serve as instructor and mentor to each of our GIS students as they complete their Capstone Projects. I work closely with the other instructors to ensure an integrated and blended learning environment across the programs.
